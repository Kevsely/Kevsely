# Hi there üëã I'm Elegis. 
My friends and programming buddies know this, but they never call me like that.
They prefer to call me Kevsely or Kev saying I look more "geeky" that way. üòé

If you find me somewhere, I'll probably be: 
- Coding üë®‚Äçüíª
- Thinking about a piece of code ü§î
- Or trying to figure out a way to solve a bug in my codes ü§Ø 

No, I'm joking. When I'm not coding, I enjoy:
- Eating ü§§
- Sleeping üò¥  
- or Skating ‚õ∏ 

That was the funny (or not) about me. 
Hope you smile when reading. üôÇ
